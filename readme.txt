Hello friends.

This is The Mother's International School's Submission for the event WebD by Arhaan Bahadur.

A small description of the website and company I designed:

Shiksha is a new way to learn, teach and mentor. The main attraction of 
our company is the fact that we found a way to convert any generic phone 
camera into a hologram. Thus, giving you a surreal experience while learning, 
chatting or having fun with your friends.

The website I developed has an extremely simple and minimal look. It uses a single 
font (Europa - regular, bold). I went for a much simpler look because an application
like this could and should be used by everyone in the world, no matter what 
phone/device they have. 

Thus, special work has been put in to make this website responsive so that it looks perfect
on every device. You don't need to have the latest devices, it works just as well on older
laptops and phones.

Education is something everyone deserves, so I believe that this pandemic should not stop 
anyone from learning. So my main motive was to use minimal libraries and make it a simple
and clear website for everyone to access. 

SVGs were used as far as possible to reduce file sizes and improve load times. Every asset used
on the website is optimized.

I did add cool parallax effects tho ;)

Also note: Illustrations, Icons, and other svg assets have been deisgned and customized by me.

Thank you, I hope you like it :)
